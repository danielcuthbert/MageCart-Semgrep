# MageCart-Semgrep


Skimmers suck. We need to do more to detect malicious skimming code embedded into websites. 
This is an attempt to create [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) rules in order to detect MageCart and other skimmer code that might have been inserted into code. 

It is a work in progress!
